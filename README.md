# powerpoint-flashcards
Immediately create a get-to-know-you flashcards PowerPoint.
Currently, it will automatically pull employee data from https://religion.byu.edu
and make a slide for each picture along with the employee's name.

Support will be later added for flashcards of employee's room numbers,
joke slides, and more command line options.
