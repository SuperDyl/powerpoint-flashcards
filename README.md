# powerpoint-flashcards
Immediately create a get-to-know-you flashcards PowerPoint.
Currently, it will automatically pull professor data from religion.byu.edu
and make a slide for each picture along with the professor's name.

Support will be later added for flashcards of professor's room numbers, joke slides,
more command line options, and support for using other BrightSpot web directories.
